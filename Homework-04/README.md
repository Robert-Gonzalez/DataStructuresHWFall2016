# Overview
Last week, you generated ASCII movies with scrolling, fixed-width sprites. 
In this assignment, you'll get a chance to make your movies more sophisticated. 
You'll make your movie work with any size sprite, and make it possible to have more than one sprite on the screen at a time. 
Along the way, you will learn some new tools (`doxygen` and `valgrind`), work with pointers and dynamic memory allocation, and gain a bit more understanding of constructors and destructors.


# Reading
Before you begin, read the [Constructors, Destructors, and Assignment](https://github.com/hmc-cs70-fall2016/Materials/blob/master/docs/ConstructorsDestructors.pdf) handout posted on the course website. We also suggest you keep the following references handy:

* The wiki pages on [`doxygen`](https://github.com/hmc-cs70-fall2016/Materials/wiki/Doxygen-HowTo) and [`valgrind`](https://github.com/hmc-cs70-fall2016/Materials/wiki/ValgrindHowTo)
* Section 3.5.3 of the *C++Primer* textbook for a review of dynamically-allocated arrays
* Sections 7.1.4-7.1.5 of the *C++ Primer* textbook for a review of constructors, destructors, and assignment operators

# Grading
Your submission will be graded as follows: 
* 15 points: correctness
* 10 points: completeness
* 6 points: style 
* 6 points: elegance
* 6 points: clarity 
* 7 points: peer review

See the [Grading Guidelines](https://github.com/hmc-cs70-fall2016/Admin/wiki/Grading-Guidelines) wiki page for more information about what we're looking for in each of those categories.
