After doing 6-7 tests, we found that messages started to be indecipherable at 
a noise level of about .3, of course we defined indecipherable to mean that 
more than 50% of the message could not be recreated by the person who received it.
For multiple tests at the same noise level, sometimes a 
transmitted message would be a lot more readable than other previously
transmitted messages.
