# Overview

Last week, you used a hash table to implement the interface for a set. This week, youâ€™ll use a balanced binary search tree to implement the same interface.

# Before You Start

You'll find that the `treeset` starter code directory is empty. As you work, you'll want to copy any files you need from last week's `hashset` directory into this week's `treeset` directory.
