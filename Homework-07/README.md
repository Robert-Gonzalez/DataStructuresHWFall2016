In this assignment, you'll implement a significant portion of the `ChunkyString` class you tested and wrote pseudocode for in Assignment 6.

# Reading
In addition to reading this assignment, we strongly recommend the following resources:
* Sections 10.4-10.6 of the _C++ Primer 5th edition_)
* Another good source for information on STL algorithms is http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/ because it actually gives you code showing you how the algorithm works.  (Remember, though, that if you later decide not to use STL algorithms, you aren't allowed to copy from or adapt this code.) Unfortunately, some iterator functions aren't documented there, but the descriptions in your textbook and elsewhere are okay if you read them carefully.  Just keep iterator-invalidation issues in mind.
* The [Homework 7 Hints and Tips](https://github.com/hmc-cs70-fall2016/Materials/wiki/HW7-Hints-Tips) wiki page, where we will collectively accumulate suggestions, fixes, and useful advice for the homework. You should definitely check this before you start the assignment, and may want to check back periodically (especially if you're having trouble with something in the assignment). 


# Grading
Your submission will be graded as follows: 
* 15 points: correctness
* 10 points: completeness
* 6 points: style 
* 6 points: elegance

See the [Grading Guidelines](https://github.com/hmc-cs70-fall2016/Materials/wiki/Grading-Guidelines) wiki page for more information about what we're looking for in each of those categories.
